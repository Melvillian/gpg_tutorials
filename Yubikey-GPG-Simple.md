# Security Token - Simple GPG Setup

These steps are the simplest way to initialize a Security Token for GPG however If you lose the key or forget the PIN, you will not be able to recover it!

This is only recommended where you universally have administrators or peers capable of revoking and rotating all of your credentials if necessary.

If you are wanting to setup a GPG on a Security Token for mixed or personal use, or are an administrator it is recommended to use the Advanced Setup which will allow you an opportunity to make a secure offline backup of key data.

## Configure PIN codes

Save the pins in your security-token encrypted password manager.

Do not use existing pins ...

## Generate Keychain

This command will force your card to generate GPG Subkeys for Signing, Encryption, and Authentication respectively and store them in the card. Your computer will never see the private key as the entire process is self-contained inside the card.
